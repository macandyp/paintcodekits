<p>PaintCode is an awesome app. A lot of iOS developers use it nearly every day, and have seen countless hours saved not having to worry about different asset sizes. While PaintCode is an incredibly useful app, it's only as good as the person clicking the mouse. Wouldn't it be great if there was a place where you could use someone else's work in your project? I definitely think so. </p>

<h2>
<a id="goal" class="anchor" href="#goal" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal</h2>

<p>If you've ever gone looking for assets for you iOS/OS X projects, you know it can be a chore to find the right ones, especially if you have to create different resolution sizes. I'd like to see this grow into something that fellow PaintCode users can come to, and find either the vector drawings they're looking for, or a great starting point.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what-this-is-not" class="anchor" href="#what-this-is-not" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What this is not</h2>

<p>This is not a place to put the generated code that PaintCode produces. While that seems really tempting, I'd like to continue to show support for PixelCutÂ©. They make a product truly worth purchasing, and this repository does not seek to stop the income they deserve. </p>

<h2>
<a id="what-to-do" class="anchor" href="#what-to-do" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What to do</h2>

<p>If you've got a PaintCode project you think is worth sharing, send me a pull request with your project and a screen shot of the stylekit (not including the code). Also include a short readme.md about what's included. Make sure you don't leave anything filled out in the StyleKit export settings (created by, name, etc.). </p>

<p>For now, this is all I can think of to start getting this moving for free for other PaintCode users. If this proves to be successful, perhaps I'll think of something better. Feel free to create an issue if you have any questions. </p>
